During the conference, I delivered a presentation titled <em>&quot;Mitigation of Vortex-Induced Vibration in Bridge Structures Using Nonlinear Energy Sink Inerter: Weight Effect and Compensational Strategies.&quot;</em></p><p>In my presentation, I explored the innovative application of a nonlinear energy sink (NES) combined with an inerter to control vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) in bridge structures. I discussed the weight effect on the performance of this system and presented compensational strategies to optimize its effectiveness. This research aims to enhance the structural stability of bridges subjected to dynamic wind forces, addressing a critical issue in civil engineering.</p><p>Visit the official conference website: <a href="https://www.ices2024.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ICES 2024</a></p><p>Download the my presentation here: <a href="https://ruihongxie.github.io/academic-site/assets/ICES%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Download Presentation</a></p>',15);function d(h,l,f,p,g,u){const e=a("NewsList");return r(),n("div",null,[c,o(e)])}const w=t(s,[["render",d]]);export{b as __pageData,w as default};
